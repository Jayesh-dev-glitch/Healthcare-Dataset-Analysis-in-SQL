# Healthcare Dataset Analysis in SQL

## üìå Project Overview
The **Healthcare Dataset Analysis in SQL** project is designed to demonstrate real-world SQL query writing and database management using healthcare-related data. This repository focuses on **patients, appointments, billing, prescriptions, and doctors** to analyze and retrieve useful insights about hospital operations.

The project includes SQL queries to:
- Manage and retrieve appointment information.
- Track billing and payment statuses.
- Identify trends in healthcare data (e.g., common appointment reasons).
- Generate key reports for doctors, patients, and financial data.
